# batch_norm_test
This repository experimentally demonstrates that while batch normalization helps with classification, it can significantly hurt autoencoding performance.

Run the trainings:

```
python classifier.py
python autoencoder.py
```

Track the trainings through the browser:

`python dashboard.py`

Generate and save figures of the logged trainings:

`python plotting.py`
